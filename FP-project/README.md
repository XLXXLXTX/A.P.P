## FP-Project

This is a Functional Programing (FP) Project implemented in Python. The assignments within this project have been crafted utilizing the principles and strategies of functional programming such as:
- Pure functions
- Higher order functions: ```filter```, ```map```, ```reduce```...
- Lambda functions 
- Immutable data structures
- List comprehension

## Description

This project consists of three assigments that take advantage of the functional programing paradigm.

-The first assignment involves implementing a program capable of reading and decoding a file, and counting the number of words in it. 

-The second assignment is to implment a program that generates a list of anagrams from a given word, and finds which of those anagrams are valid words. Using the ```map``` and ```filter``` functions.

-The third assignment is to implement a program to manage a movie system. The program should be able to add movies, delete movies, search for movies, and display all movies. Similar to the [OOP-Project](OOP-project) but this time, simpler and using functional programing style strategies like higher order functions, lambda functions, list comprehension, etc. to perform operations instead of classes and objects.


## How to run?
