## OPP-Project

This is an Object Oriented Programing (OPP) Project implemented in Python. The primary goal is to develop a program for managing the inventory of an online store.

## Description

In this project, there are several tasks: implementing a series of model for the objects within the store, ensuring persistence for the data through JSON and providing a simple interface/menu to navigate through the system.

## How to run? 

To run this project, ensure you are in the ```OOP-Project``` folder. Then you need to execute the ```main.py``` file:

```
    python3 main.py
```

## Tests

If you want to run tests to verify the functionality of the system, you have two options:


- Run the "Manual" Test file, which was the initial testing script for the project:
``` 
    python3 manual_tests.py
```

- Alternatively, run the Unit Test file, named unit_test.py (similar to manual_tests.py but using the Unit testing library):
```
    python3 unit_tests.py
```
